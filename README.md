# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

The client Louise is looking for relevant trends when it comes to Kickstarter's fundraising campaigns. She already achieved success in her last play *Fever* and is currently planning her next step. In order to make more conscious decisions we will analyze a database with 4115 fundraising outcomes, giving special attention to launch dates and goals.

### Purpose

Help Louise plan her campaign by doing data analysis on kickstarter projects to uncover hidden trends about launch dates and goals. 


## Analysis and Challenges

Data base and analysis available on [KickStarter Challenge](https://github.com/GabrielaTuma/kickstarter-analysis/blob/main/Kickstarter_Challenge.xlsx)

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

When looking at the outcomes month by month a trend is very clear in the Theatre category. 1369 campaigns were taken into consideration and an uncanny rate of success is observed in the month of May, June and July, but specially May. Also, rates of failed fundraisings and successful ones is very similar from October to December, giving valuable information to Louise. 

Even using the filter to narrow the research to recent years, May shows a great rate of success and the last quarter of the year proves to be a bad choice when it comes to launching a theatre campaign.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

Louise's first play had a goal of $12,000 and now we want to give her a deeper analysis of the outcomes based on goals. By dividing them into ranges we can see that the subcategory plays, inside the theatre category, has a high rate of success when the goal is 5 thousand of less. We can also see a good percentage of success in campaigns with goal between 35 and 45 thousands, however, we need to take into consideration that those numbers are based in a very small amount of fundraising campaigns, that should be investigated individually to understand the causes. 

Louise needs to change her strategy and lower her goal or investigate successful plays with considerably high budgets in case lowering the goal is not a viable option.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

It's a lot of information and categories at first, it can be overwhelming. But after cleaning the data, and focusing on the relevant columns and rows it gets easier to start the analysis. Knowing how to use the correct tools to sort the relevant data and using visual methods were really important as well.
